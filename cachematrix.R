## makeCacheMatrix is a function that creates a "matrix" object that caches 
## its inverse. 
## cacheSolve does the actual computation of the inverse of the object returned
## by makeCacheMatrix. cacheSolve uses the solve(X)function in R. 

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
